You must\n            declare a variable before you can use it for any purpose.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            JavaScript is a weak typed language. It does not have a type system\n            meaning that you don't have to specify the type of a variable.\n            JavaScript will automatically assign the type of a variable based on\n            the value that it is assigned. Unlike other languages like Java, C,\n            C++, etc, you have to specify the type of a variable such as int,\n            string, float, and etc.\n          </p>\n          <p>Following below is an examples of a variable in JavaScript.</p>\n\n          <h1> Var variable </h1>\n          <p>\n            The var keyword is used to declare a variable. The var keyword is a\n            global variable. It can be used anywhere in the program. The var is\n            a old variable keyword in JavaScript and still in use.\n          </p>\n          <HtmlCssJsEditor props={JsVar} />\n          <h1>Let variable</h1>\n          <p>\n            Since 2015, the let keyword was introduced in JavaScript. The let\n            keyword is a local variable. It can be used only within the block it\n            was defined. You must use the let variable when there is a chance\n            that the variable will be reassigned or changed.\n          </p>\n          <HtmlCssJsEditor props={JsLet} />\n          <h1>Const variable</h1>\n          <p>\n            Since 2015, the const keyword was introduced in JavaScript. The\n            const keyword is a constant variable. It can be used only within the\n            block it was defined. It can't be reassigned and changed. The const\n            variable is very strict but easy to understand.\n          </p>\n          <HtmlCssJsEditor props={JsConst} />\n\n          <h1>Using Nothing</h1>\n          <p> I am using nothing type variable in the function parameters.</p>\n          <HtmlCssJsEditor props={JsNothing} />\n          <p>\n            The reason I am using nothing type variable is because I am not sure\n            if the variable will be reassigned or changed. I didn't give the\n            variable a type and JavaScript will assign the type of the variable\n            based on the value that it is assigned automatically.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div id=\"right\">\n          <RelatedCssLinks />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":["LeftNav","lazy","RelatedCssLinks","HtmlCssJsEditor","JsVariables","UseTitle","id","props"],"sourceRoot":""}
