If you are\r\n            new to web programming, you should start with JavaScript. Once you\r\n            mastered javascript, you can pick up javascript frameworks and\r\n            libraries like React, Vue, Angular, and many more and other\r\n            programming languages like Python, C, C++, C#, Java, etc very\r\n            easily.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based\r\n            and interpreted programming language. It was created by Brendan Eich\r\n            in 1995. It is a cross-platform language, meaning that it can be run\r\n            on any computer with a web browser. It is a prototype-based\r\n            language, meaning that it is a dynamically typed language. It is a\r\n            weakly typed language, meaning that it does not have a type system.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language. It has both object-oriented\r\n            and functional programming styles. It has both dynamic and static\r\n            typing and scoping. JavaScript can be used in the following\r\n            features:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Client-side scripting</li>\r\n            <li>Server-side scripting</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Scripting for mobile devices and embedded devices (such as phones\r\n              and tablets)\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>Scripting for the web browser</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Scripting for machine learning and artificial intelligence (such\r\n              as speech recognition)\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div id=\"right\">\r\n          <RelatedCssLinks />\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["LeftNav","lazy","RelatedCssLinks","JsHome","UseTitle","id"],"sourceRoot":""}
