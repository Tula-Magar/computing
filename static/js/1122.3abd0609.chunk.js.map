The for loop is used to\r\n            iterate over a list of items. The while loop is used to execute a\r\n            block of code as long as a condition is true. Other loops are made\r\n            up of for and while loops such as do while, and for each and for in.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h1>for loop</h1>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The for loop is used to iterate over a list of items.

The do while loop is similar to the while\r\n            loop, except that the do while loop will execute at least once. The\r\n            do while loop will execute the code inside the curly braces at least\r\n            once, even if the condition is false the first time. The do while\r\n            loop is useful when you want to execute the code inside the curly\r\n            braces at least once, even if the condition is false the first time.\r\n            The code goes to do block and condition check goes to the while\r\n            block.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <HtmlCssJsEditor props={DoWhileLoop} />\r\n          <h1>For Each Loop</h1>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The for each loop is used to iterate over a list of items.
