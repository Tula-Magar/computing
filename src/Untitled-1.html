            display style to vertical panel on the left side. Before this new update, we used to see navigation panel display on the buttom left side of outlook. Now, Microsoft are letting to use some user who has turn
            on "Comming Soon" feature. People has "Comming Soon" feature are having confusion over this new update. You can turn off the "Comming Soon" and don't use it until new feature are
            permenently avaiable to everyone or get use it ahead than most people. I would suggest IT professional to use this feature as soon as possible and get familiar with the new navigation panel 
            display style so, you will assist other people fast and concise way.
